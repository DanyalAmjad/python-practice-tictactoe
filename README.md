# TicTacToe

After finishing the CS101 path on CodeCademy, I decided to put my skills to the test and build this game. As the first project, I got carried away with adding many features and making the task more complicated. In the future, to avoid this, I will create an outline before coding. I hope you will check it out and let me know what you think!

## Features

There are three game modes:
1. 2-Player
2. 1-Player vs AI (AI makes random decisions)
3. AI vs AI (if you wanna kick back and watch the random-ness)

Choose Player Names and Symbol to play with.
- If first player chooses one of the `[X, O]` symbols, the second player will have the remaining assigned automatically
- Player 1 can choose any symbol (!,@,#,$,%,^,&)    **Not a feature but a bug** XD

Who goes first options:
1. Player 1
2. Player 2
3. Coin Toss

End of Game Goodies
1) Non-AI players can choose to see list of play-by-plays for the game
2) Non-AI players can choose to have a re-match

** Caution: *Currently the project is un-polished which will run into errors if the user input is different from prompts.*
Python Version: 3.8.5
